        "- **Document Loading**: Automatically loads PDF, DOCX, and TXT files from GCS bucket\n",
        "- **Text Processing**: Intelligently splits documents into searchable chunks\n",
        "- **Vector Search**: Uses advanced embeddings for semantic similarity search\n",
        "- **AI Question Answering**: Powered by Gemini 2.5 Pro for natural language responses\n",
        "- **Source Attribution**: Shows which documents were used to answer questions\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🚀 Next Steps:\n",
        "1. **Add More Documents**: Upload more files to your GCS bucket and re-run the setup\n",
        "2. **Customize Parameters**: Adjust chunk size, embedding models, or search parameters in the config\n",
        "3. **Advanced Features**: Add document filtering, different prompt templates, or conversation memory\n",
        "4. **UI Integration**: Build a web interface using Streamlit or Gradio\n",
        "5. **Production Setup**: Add error handling, logging, and monitoring\n",
