It operates 624\\nstores in over 30 countries, over 100 [ 4 ] of\\nwhich are in Germany.\\nToday's Metro was created in 2017 through\\nthe spin-off of the Metro Cash & Carry and\\nReal retail chains from the old Metro into\\nMetro Wholesale & Food Specialist AG ,\\nwhich later renamed itself Metro. The old\\nMetro corporate shell, which retained the\\nMediaMarktSaturn retail chains ,\\nsubsequently renamed itself Ceconomy . The\\nnew Metro sold the Real retail chain in 2020 ,\\nleaving only the Metro Cash & Carry stores in\\nthe company. [ 5 ]\\nThe history of Metro began on November 8,\\n1963, in Essen-Vogelheim with the opening of\\nthe first self-service wholesale market under\\nthe name Metro, which still exists today. The\\nmarket in Mülheim an der Ruhr, which also still exists\\ntoday , was added as a second location at the end of 1964.\\n[ 6 ] [ 7 ] The founding partners of the first market in Essen\\nwere two food wholesalers, the brothers Ernst Schmidt and\\nWilhelm Schmidt-Ruthenbeck , who were the second\\ngeneration to successfully run the company Karl Schmidt\\nOHG, founded by their father in 1923, in Duisburg's inner\\nharbor and supplied over 500  SPAR food retailers . Wilhelm Schmidt-Ruthenbeck was the main\\noriginator of the idea. He probably derived the name \\\"Metro\\\" from the term \\\"metropolis\\\". He had\\nthe name rights for \\\"Metro\\\" protected early on (also after consulting with the then Hollywood giant\\n\\\"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\\\"), which was possible at the time without remuneration. [ 7 ] [ 8 ]\\nThe self-service wholesale distribution type (cash-and-carry market) came to Germany from the\\nUSA in the late 1950s and early 1960s, particularly through the Ratio markets of Terfloth & Snoek\\nin Münster and Bochum, as well as the markets of Handelshof in Haan , Cologne, and\\nStory\\nFounding and expansion\\n14/08/2025, 22:52 Metro AG – Wikipedia\\nhttps://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_AG 1/18\",\"type\":\"Document\"}\n",
